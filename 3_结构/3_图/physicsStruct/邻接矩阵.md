##  邻接矩阵
be use in 有向图 and 无向图
`a[vx][vx] = 0`
use 二维数组

```shell
  v0v1v2   vmvn
v0[][][]...[][]
v1[][][]...[][]
	...
vm[][][]...[][]
vn[][][]...[][]
```

* 无向图
if v0 to 邻接点v1 have edge, `a[v0][v1] = <weight>/1;a[v1][v0] = <weight>/1` rather than is `无限大/0` 

* 有向图
if v0 -> 邻接点v1 have edge, `a[v0][v1] = <weight>/1` rather than is `无限大/0`
